# Football Analysis Project‚öΩÔ∏èüìä

## Description
This project focuses on detecting and tracking players, referees, and the ball in football match footage using YOLO, a state-of-the-art object detection model. Additionally, it enhances model accuracy through training and leverages K-Means clustering for team classification based on jersey colors.

<br>

## Features

* **Real-Time Object Detection:**  Detects and tracks players, referees, and the football using YOLOv11.
*  **Team Classification via Jersey Colors:** Uses K-Means clustering to segment player jerseys by color.
* **Ball Possession Analysis:** Calculates team-wise ball possession percentages based on object tracking.
* **Camera Motion Estimation:** Implements Optical Flow to measure camera movements between frames.
* **Player Movement & Speed Analysis:**  Perspective Transformation is applied to measure real-world distances. 
* **Comprehensive Performance Metrics:** Provides movement heatmaps, distance covered, and speed analysis per player.
