This directory contains trained model weights. However, to avoid exceeding GitHub's storage limits, these files have not been uploaded here.

If you want to retrain the model, you can run the following command:
!yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolo11m.pt data={dataset.location}/data.yaml epochs=100 imgsz=640

After training is complete, two files will be generated: 'best.pt' and 'last.pt'.
- best.pt  -> The model weights with the best accuracy.
- last.pt  -> The model weights saved at the final epoch.

These files can be stored on platforms like Google Drive.
